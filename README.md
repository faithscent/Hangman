## Hangman

> A Hangman Game that asks the user for a letter and checks if it is in the word. It starts with a default number of lives and a random word from the word_list.
> The Game allows the player to pick a random letter from a word_list, the player is given 5 opportunities to get it right.
> Using the ask_letter method the player can input a letter only and only one character at a time
> I created a method called check_letter which tracks the letters guessed is right or wrong and if wrong the player losses lifes
